                <p class="description">My name is Henry. I am a self-taught Frontend Developer working towards becoming a Full Stack Developer. 
                I am fluent in three languages, written and orally, which I try to showcase by this little Javascript project. 
                My tech-journey began in early 2021 when I started to learn Python. At one point however, I was more attracted by
                frontend development which is why I started to learn HTML/SCSS and Javascript. Later I added libraries like Bootstrap and GSAP
                to my skills. Currently I'm working with NodeJS and VueJS. In my freetime I like to combine many pull-ups with good coffee, and
                up my sourdough game.</p>
